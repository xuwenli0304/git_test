1 by default, if we call getbean with class name from ioc container, we will get the same object.
  so by default the bean is single instance.

2 i guess if the creation of bean is managed by the ioc container(for exmaple with configuration annotation),
  we cannot create it mamually any more.
  to create bean with annotation with custom name, the class must be "clean"
