1. on required level, this log says we are successful:
2022-07-24 21:54:12.666 DEBUG 15616 --- [nio-8090-exec-2] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager        : Participating in existing transaction

2. REQUIRE_NEW works similarly.
   2022-07-24 21:58:43.999 DEBUG 3168 --- [nio-8090-exec-1] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager        : Suspending current transaction, creating new transaction with name [config.MyBatisService.addUserMPart]
   2022-07-24 21:58:44.422 DEBUG 3168 --- [nio-8090-exec-1] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager        : Suspending current transaction, creating new transaction with name [config.MyBatisService.addUserMPart]

3. remember not to put them in the same class, or the proxy will invalidate.

4. NESTED needs the db to support savepoint, if sub-transaction fails,
   do not rollback the current.
   if db not support, use RN instead.
   NESTED has derivation relation, while RN not.
