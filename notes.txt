1 here we set option lazyinit as true, so if we do not get the bean from the ioc-container, the bean 
  will not be created.
  if now we get it explicitly, here we can see we do not initialize animal instance in the constructor,
  but that member has been initialized as well. from the output, we can conclude that maybe the framework
  tried to make every member initialized, if the animal member could not be initialized from the constructor,
  the framework would find the respective set method to initialize it.
