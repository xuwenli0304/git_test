1 on this step, if we remove the excludefilter, the notscan isntance can be created.
  but now, the exception will be raised and caught.

2 I wonder why nosuchbeandefinition cannot be caught?

3 the excludefilter needs some annotation as input, in fact, we can write our own customed annotation
  to determine which bean should not be loaded.
