1. firstly we have a validator interface, then we have an implementation for it.
   when we use @DeclareParents, it's just like we add the defaultImpl function to the value class.
   so the name is @DeclareParents and we can cast the child type to the parent type(
     the defaultImpl's respective interface, in fact.
   ).

2. adding the + sign will raise exceptions: https://segmentfault.com/q/1010000018606803

3. usually we do not add parent to the pojo but the service.
